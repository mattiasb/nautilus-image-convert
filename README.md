# Nautilus Image Convert

Convert several images using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php).

## Features

- Add borders to images.

## Installation

1. Ensure you're running Ubuntu 22.04.
2. Download [image-convert-installer v0.1][1].
3. Right-click `image-convert-installer` in `Files` and make it executable
   (TODO! EXPLAIN!).
4. Right-click `image-convert-installer` again and press `Run as a program` to
   actually install it.
5. You can run this command again to *uninstall* the script.

**NOTE**: If you don't trust me personally, please review the code before
          running it on your own computer!

## Usage

1. Mark one or several image files in `Files`.
2. Right-click and select `Image - Add border`.
3. Follow the wizard.
4. The converted files will end up in an `out/` subdirectory to ensure that your
   current files are untouched!

## Warning

While I haven't experienced any bugs — and do believe that this code *won't* eat
your files or your cats — please make sure to have backups of your important
files before running this code. :)
